# UnblockReceipts

Do you work in web3, on behalf a web2 or web1 organization that still has to report to web0 tax authorities? UnblockReceipts is for you and for all the other bridge-builders, scouts, and explorers that an increasing number of traditional organizations are sending out to explore the new web3 world, while still running under older policies and practices.

From a purely rational standpoint, it might not be not worth it for a company to spend a blockchain specialistâ€™s time filling out expense reports for every few-dollar gas fee, especially if that requires looking up exchange rates as of some particular time and doing various currency conversions.  Even just anticipating the paperwork can have a taxing and chilling effect on what might otherwise be profitable business activity.

However, expense reporting does have important purposes, for example in helping business leaders accurately understand the financial health of their enterprise and in accurately reporting business-associated costs to tax authorities.

UnblockReceipts solves this conundrum by using software to automate the paperwork burden.  Business leaders and tax authorities can get all the benefits of accurate expense reporting, while also saving the business staff time spent on filling out those expense reports and enabling specialists to more rapidly explore the business opportunities in this new web3 world.

UnblockReceipts is a simple service that, given a transaction identifier (hash), generates a traditional receipt for a transaction fee paid on a selected EVM-compatible chain.  The receipt shows the amount of the transaction fee in the native token (ETH, MATIC, or equivalent) and pulls data from an oracle source or centralized exchange (initially, the same for all users) about the USD exchange value of that token as of the block timestamp.
